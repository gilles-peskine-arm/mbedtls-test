# Purpose
# -------
#
# This docker file is for creating the Linux image that is used in the
# CI with proprietary Arm compilers. It can also be used for reproducing and
# testing CI failures if you have access to the Arm internal license servers,
# or if you have access to different license servers by overriding the
# ARMLMD_LICENSE_FILE argument when building the image
# (docker build --build-arg ARMLMD_LICENSE_FILE=... arm-compilers).

# For now, copy the ARM compilers from a fixed image which is present in our caches.
# This avoids the problem that the download URLs for Arm compilers are
# not longer valid.
